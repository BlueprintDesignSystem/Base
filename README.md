Blueprint Design System - Design Tokens

We use design tokens for the following reasons:

1. Consistency: Design tokens help ensure consistency in design across all touchpoints and platforms, making it easier for users to recognize Buildertrend's brand identity.

2. Scalability: Design tokens make it easier to scale Blueprint as it grows and evolves, ensuring that changes to the system can be made in a controlled and organized manner.

3. Flexibility: Design tokens allow designers and developers to work with a flexible and modular system that can adapt to different screen sizes and devices.

4. Reusability: Design tokens promote reusability by providing a single source of truth for common design elements.

5. Efficiency: Design tokens streamline the design and development process by reducing the time spent on manual updates.

6. Accessibility: Design tokens can be used to ensure that designs meet accessibility standards by providing a consistent visual language and ensuring that accessibility considerations are built into the design system from the start.

7. Internationalization: Design tokens can be used to create a design system that can be easily adapted for different languages and cultural contexts.

8. Maintainability: Design tokens make it easier to maintain a design system over time by providing a single source of truth for design decisions.

9. Collaboration: Design tokens promote collaboration between designers, developers, and stakeholders by providing a shared design language.

10. Brand Identity: Design tokens help to reinforce Buildertrend's visual identity by providing a consistent and recognizable visual language across all touchpoints and platforms.
